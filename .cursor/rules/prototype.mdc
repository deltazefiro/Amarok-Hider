# Prototype Guidelines

1. Use `debugPref` in `ui/settings/AboutCategory.java` as your prototype entry point:
    - For feature testing: Trigger your new code when `debugPref` is clicked
    - For UI testing: Launch your test view when `debugPref` is clicked
2. Use `R.drawable.ic_null` instead of creating new drawable assets
3. Keep changes minimal and prefer adding new code over modifying existing code
