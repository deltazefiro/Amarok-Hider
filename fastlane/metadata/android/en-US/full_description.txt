<p> Amarok is an Android application which enables you to hide your private files & apps with just one click.</p><p> In many cases, we use sophisticated encryptors to encrypt our files and apps, just not wanting others to see them. However, many of these encryptors are slow and resource-intensive, making the encryption of large files such as videos and music a daunting task. While these solutions may be secure, they are often overkill for the average user who simply wants to prevent others from accidentally accessing their private files and apps.</p><p> Amarok is designed specifically for these situations, as it is a lightweight file and app "hider". It only obscures filenames and file signatures, making files unreadable to humans, and this process can be done almost instantly regardless of the size of the file. Additionally, it "disables" apps, effectively hiding them from the launcher. All of these functions can be accomplished with just one click.</p><b>Features</b><ul> <li><b>High-speed Large File Hiding</b>: Obfuscate filenames and file signatures to make files unreadable. </li> <li><b>Root-free Application Hiding</b>: Make apps invisible on the launcher. Currently, it supports Root, Shizuku and DSM modes.</li> <li><b>Exquisite UI</b>: Full Material3 design.</li></ul><p> <b><u>NOTE: AMAROK IS NOT AN ENCRYPTION TOOL. IT JUST "OBFUSCATE" FILES SO THEY CAN NOT BE READ BY HUMANS AND DISABLE APPS TO "HIDE". THESE PROCESSES CAN BE EASILY REVERTED. DO NOT USE AMAROK TO PROTECT IMPORTANT FILES! </u></b></p>
