<p> Amarok - Android lietotne, kas ļauj paslēpt personiskās datnes un lietotnes tikai ar vienu klikšķi.</p><p> Often, we resort to complex encryptors to secure our files and apps, aiming to shield them from prying eyes. These encryptors, while effective, tend to be slow and resource-intensive, making the encryption of large files such as videos and music a daunting task. Despite their robust security, these methods are often overkill for the average user who simply wish to keep their private files and apps out of unintentional reach.</p><p> Amarok is designed to be a light-weight hider. It disguises file names and headers, causing them to seem "corrupted" and unopenable. Amarok also deactivates applications, rendering them invisible in the launcher and system menu.</p><p><b>Funkcijas</b></p><ul> <li><strong>Lietotājam draudzīgs</strong>: Viegli paslēpt failus un lietotnes ar vienu klikšķi.</li> <li><strong>Rapid and Efficient Large File Hiding</strong>: Hides by altering only file name and signature, unaffected by file size.</li> <li><strong>Root-Free Application Hiding</strong>: Makes apps vanish from the launcher.
